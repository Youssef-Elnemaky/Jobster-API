# Jobster API

Jobster is a RESTful API for user authentication and job management built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT**. It provides endpoints for registering and logging in users, as well as managing job entries (create, read, update, delete) for authenticated users. A special **test user** has **read-only** access. API documentation is available via **Swagger UI**.
